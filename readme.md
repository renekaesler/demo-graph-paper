# Graph Paper

**Graph Paper** is a demo written in JavaScript using the **Canvas 2D API**.

The centerpiece of this demo is the graph paper itself, which replicates the traditional grid pattern commonly used for plotting data, drawing diagrams, or solving mathematical equations. The lines on this digital version do not scale. Instead, only the spaces between the lines, adjust their size.
